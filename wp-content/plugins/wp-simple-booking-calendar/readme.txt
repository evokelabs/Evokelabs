Use the 'Generate token' field below your editor. An example of a token: [sbc id="1" legend="no" title="yes" view="1"]. If you paste this token in a page it will show the calendar with ID 1, no legend, with title and a 1 month view.

= How can I remove the calendar title from displaying? =

Edit the shortcode: title="no".
